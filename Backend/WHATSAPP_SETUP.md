# WhatsApp Notifications Setup (FREE!)

## 🚀 Free WhatsApp Notifications for Fall Detection

I've implemented WhatsApp notifications using **CallMeBot API** which is completely FREE!

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install CallMeBot WhatsApp
1. **On your phone**: Install **CallMeBot** app from Play Store/App Store
2. **Sign up** with your phone number
3. **Get your API key** from the app settings

### Step 2: Alternative - Use WhatsApp Web
If you don't want to install the app:

1. **Go to**: [CallMeBot WhatsApp Web](https://www.callmebot.com/blog/free-api-whatsapp-messages/)
2. **Click**: "Start WhatsApp Web"
3. **Scan QR code** with your WhatsApp
4. **Send message**: `/start` to the bot
5. **Get API key** from the response

### Step 3: Update Railway Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard → Variables, add:
```
WHATSAPP_PHONE=+1234567890
WHATSAPP_API_KEY=your-callmebot-api-key
EMAIL_USERNAME=your-outlook-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-outlook-password
FALL_DETECTION_EMAIL=soorya1133@gmail.com
SENDER_EMAIL=kingdpk8@gmail.com
```

### Step 4: Test WhatsApp Notifications
```bash
POST https://remotehealthsystem-production.up.railway.app/api/ts/test-fall-detection-email
Authorization: Bearer my-local-dev-token
```

## 🎯 What You'll Get
